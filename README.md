# Butterfield's Fullstack Testing Technologies Repo

This repo/project will house all of the frontend learning and experimental material and code. I want this to be a long running repo where I continue to add and experiment with new and old technologies.

### Technologies - Current Use

- HTML(5)
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Technologies - Future Use

- Php (backend)
- Tailwind
- Go (backend)

### NOTICE

Some pages may look incomplete, this is by design because some pages may exist to hold JS or backend logic
